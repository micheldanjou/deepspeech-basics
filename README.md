# deepspeech-basics
I am creating this project to learn about DeepSpeech.
Nothing fancy here.

The jupyter notebook covers how to setup a Google Colab environment for **Mozilla's implmentation of DeepSpeech 0.6.1**:
  * install `git ls`
  * download the DeepSpeech model
  * download the checkpoint file
  * download the sample audio files
  * clone Mozilla's git repo
  * `pip install deepspeech`
  * `pip install -r requirements.txt
  
The notebook continues on with 
  * running a transcription example from Mozilla's docs.
  * running a training example from Mozilla's docs.
